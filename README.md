This TodoApp is developed with React Native and Expo.

### Persistance

Tasks and reminders are stored into a **SQLite** database in the device.

### Challenges Faced

- UI/UX Design:

Crafting an intuitive interface proved to be a challenge. I incorporated UI libraries like React Native Paper to enhance the visual appeal. Testing the usability with potential users and collecting feedback has been instrumental in refining the user experience of my ToDo app.

- Database Integration:

Integrating SQLite as the database posed challenges in establishing and managing connections. I addressed this by handling database connections meticulously and utilizing async/await to manage asynchronous database operations in my ToDo app.
